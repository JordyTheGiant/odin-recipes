    <h3>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</h3>
    
    <p>Katsu is a Japanese dish of crispy fried cutlets coated with Panko bread crumbs. Popular varieties are chicken katsu (like this recipe) and tonkatsu (which is made with pork).</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Chicken: You'll need four skinless, boneless chicken breast halves.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: This chicken katsu recipe is simply seasoned with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Flour: All-purpose flour helps seal in the moisture, adds flavor, and promotes browning.</li>
        <li>Egg: An egg adds moisture and gives the Panko something to stick to.</li>
        <li>Panko: Panko bread crumbs are responsible for katsu's signature crunch.</li>
        <li>Oil: Opt for a neutral oil with a high smoke point, such as canola or vegetable oil.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to 1/2 inch thickness</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        <li>That's it! Serve with sticky white rice and Tonkatsu Sauce for ultimate enjoyment!</li>
    </ol>
